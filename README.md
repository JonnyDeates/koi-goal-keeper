# Koi Goal Keeper
## Developed by Jonny Deates

This app is designed for a consumer to have an easy and accessible way to consistantly update their goals and priorites. The application restricts the dates you can set goals, to be now intervals. So what ever time it is now plus the time of selected options like Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly, and 5-Year Goals. This allows the user to focus more on the goal and not when to set the deadline.
