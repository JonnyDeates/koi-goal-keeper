# Introduction
A full stack application created for the easy posting, updating, and archiving of personal goals of individuals and inspired by the own need for something as such. The site minimizes the Users need to select timing and heavily focuses on the substance being the goals. Each goal can be checked off, edited, transfered, and deleted. The website uses a sql database to store all of the data with a middleman api that I also developed. The site includes full security for the user, and proper encryption of the persons data.
